# Blockchain & Smart Contract - NFT Marketplace

## üì¶ Overview

This is a fully functional **NFT Marketplace** built using **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **Hardhat** for deploying and managing smart contracts on the **Goerli test network**. This project allows users to mint NFTs on the blockchain, providing an interactive and decentralized experience.

> **Note**: As this is deployed on a test network (Goerli), the NFT creation is limited and requires minimal balance to mint. Currently, I do not have sufficient balance in my Goerli account to mint NFTs, but the contract works as intended.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Frontend**: Developed using React, users can connect their wallet using **MetaMask** to interact with the application.
- **Backend**: Built using **Node.js**, which communicates with the Ethereum network via smart contracts.
- **Smart Contract**: Deployed on the **Goerli test network** using **Hardhat**.
- **NFT Creation**: Anyone with a MetaMask wallet can create NFTs on the test network (requires some ETH in the wallet).
- **Test Environment**: This application is running on the Goerli test network, so no real transactions occur.
